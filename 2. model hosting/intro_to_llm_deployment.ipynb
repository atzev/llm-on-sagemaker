    "# Introduction to Large Language Model Hosting on SageMaker with DeepSpeed Container\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Note: The below code has been adapted from https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/main/inference/generativeai/llm-workshop/lab1-deploy-llm </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore how to host a large language model on SageMaker using the [Large Model Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-large-model-inference.html) container that is optimized for hosting large models using DJLServing. DJLServing is a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by the Deep Java Library (DJL) that is programming language agnostic. To learn more about DJL and DJLServing, you can refer to our recent [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-large-models-on-amazon-sagemaker-using-djlserving-and-deepspeed-model-parallel-inference/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as Hugging Face and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we deploy the open source GPT-J Model which is comprised of 6B parameters on a single GPU. Along the way we will explore approaches that will allow us to scale to larger models with practically no code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was tested on a `ml.t3.medium` instance using the `Python 3 (Data Science)` kernel on SageMaker Studio."

    "2. `option.entryPoint` - specifies the entrypoint code that will be used to host the model. Python scripts that use DeepSpeed can not be launched as traditional python scripts (i.e. python `deepspeed.py` would not work.) Setting `engine=DeepSpeed` will automatically configure the environment and launch the inference script appropriatelly.  \n",
    "3. `option.s3url` - specifies the location of the model files. Alternativelly an `option.model_id` option can be used instead to specifiy a model from Hugging Face Hub (e.g. `EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B`) and the model will be automatically downloaded from the Hub. The s3url approach is recommended as it allows you to host the model artifact within your own environment and enables faster deployments by utilizing optimized approach within the DJL inference container to transfer the model from S3 into the hosting instance \n",
    "4. `option.task` - This is specific to the `huggingface.py` inference handler and specifies for which task this model will be used\n",
